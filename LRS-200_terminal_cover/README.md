## LRS-200 Terminal Cover

This is a cover for the LRS-200 power supply to keep fingers off of exposed mains screws.

This is based on the work by Samwiseg0 -- https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/samwiseg0

I had to thin the walls on the outer edges so that the cover would slip between the terminal block and the power supply frame and also not crowd the voltage adjust trim screw.
